# 🐹 Go Programming Journey

Welcome to my Go (Golang) learning repository! This project serves as a structured collection of my experiments, exercises, and deep dives into the Go programming language.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This repository is organized by topics, starting from the basics and moving towards more advanced concepts.

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.20+ recommended)

### Directory Structure

│   ├── 01_hello_world/   # The absolute basics
│   ├── 02_variables/     # Storing data
│   ├── 03_control_flow/  # If/Else and Loops
│   ├── 04_data_structures/ # Arrays, Slices, and Maps
│   └── 05_functions/     # Reusable logic
└── README/               # Detailed documentation and notes
```

### Running the Code

To run any lesson, navigate to the folder and run:

```bash
cd GET_STARTED/01_hello_world
go run main.go
```

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Fundamentals (`GET_STARTED/hello_go`)

- Printing to console (string, int, float, bool)
- Variable declarations (standard and shorthand)
- Constants and constant grouping
- Control flow: `for` loops (range-based and condition-based)

### 2. Data Structures (`GET_STARTED/array`)

- Fixed-size arrays
- Initialization patterns
- Multi-dimensional (2D) arrays

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Go Compiler**: The powerful toolset for building and running Go code.
- **VS Code**: Recommended for its excellent Go extension support.
